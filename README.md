# ChromePastelFluoWebTheme
This a theme to dark web pages, chrome protocol ui and url prefixes are not well done entirely(ex:chrome://), only the stylish code editor inside the extension page configuration part, inside theme manager and editor is compatible, you should use another theme to have complete UI in the same theme.  The current stylish editor or the way the theme is interpreted does not permit to allow or refuse(only chrome) a web site itself or a regex of part of the URL. Anyway the most reliable way to do and keep them all is restrict maximum global scope to whole web and exceptionnaly shut it down.
