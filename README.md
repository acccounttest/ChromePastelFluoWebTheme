# ChromePastelFluoWebTheme
This a theme to dark web pages, chrome protocol UI and URL prefixes are not well done entirely(ex:chrome://), only the stylish code editor inside the extension page configuration part, inside theme manager and editor is compatible, you should use another theme to have complete UI in the same theme.  The current stylish editor or the way the theme is interpreted does not permit to allow or refuse(only chrome) a web site itself or a regex of part of the URL(Except Firefox, need an extension for chrome, anyway i ll publish list of extension related that works or not.).
The most reliable way to do and keep them all is restrict maximum global scope to whole web and exceptionnaly shut it down.

Exemple using another theme made for Git Pages[https://acccounttest.github.io/DarkChromePastelFluoWebTheme-trick-for-aim-stylish-editor-maybe-or-any-other-editors]
This last url is not representative of all possibilities and exceptions, usually UI tend to be more often changed, the foreground/background can change up to 3-4 differents combinaisons, here the code tag is not much influenced.
